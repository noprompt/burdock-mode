# parser emits warnings upon load which is not appropriate for this
# project. unparser, which depends on parser, thusly causes the same
# problem. $stderr needs to be temporarily suppressed while loading
# either of these gems which requires custom handling. Therefore we
# cannot rely on Bundler to require these gems for us.

# See lib/burdock/parser.rb and lib/burdock/unparser.rb
